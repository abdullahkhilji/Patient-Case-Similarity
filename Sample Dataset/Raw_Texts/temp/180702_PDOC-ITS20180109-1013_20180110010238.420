Additional Comment Re: HPI
Chart reviewed.
As patient has high triglycerides, he will be placed on low cholesterol diet and started on a statin.

Patient was seen and evaluated. He appeared visibly depressed, with poor eye contact (had his arms over his eyes mostly). He stated that his life has been going downhill for months now, starting after he had discharged himself from rehab after meeting a woman. Although he was in a relationship, he mostly stayed at the LOCATION (where he endorses poor sleep, averaging around 3hrs). Last night, he had stayed over at her house and, upon waking up, had seen her kissing and 'doing other sexual things' with his friend whom she had invited over. After leaving her house, he had gone to the ferry, and asked police to bring him here.

Although he has no plan, he endorses active suicidal ideation, depressed mood, with fluctuating appetite. Late last night he had ingested $40 bags worth of crack/cocaine (snorting and smoking). Despite his relapse with drugs, patient relates that his biggest issue is his mental health. He also has no family or social support as well. No current symptoms of mania were reported or elicited during the evaluation.

In regards to his medication, he endorses occasionally forgetting his medications and experiencing nonspecific 'withdrawal' symptoms from his Paxil.

Patient continues to require further stabilization. His Depakote 500mg BID will be continued, along with Seroquel. Will discontinue Paxil, which can cause a switch to mania in a bipolar patient.
